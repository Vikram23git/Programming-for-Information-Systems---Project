# Programming-for-Information-Systems---Project
Company Name : The Bookworm
i have selected "The Bookworm" as the specific organization for this Information System for several key reasons:

Clear Core Business: A bookstore, especially one combined with a cafe, has a very tangible and easily definable core business: managing inventory (books), sales, and potentially customer interactions. 

Identifiable Data Entities: The primary data entity is "Book," which has straightforward attributes (Title, Author, ISBN, Stock). This simplicity allows for a clear focus on CRUD operations without getting bogged down in complex data relationships for a proof-of-concept.

Direct Operational Benefits: Even a basic system can significantly improve efficiency for a small bookstore by:
->Accurate Inventory: Knowing exactly what books are in stock and where.
->Faster Sales/Lookup: Quickly finding books for customers.
->Reduced Manual Errors: Automating data entry and updates reduces mistakes common with paper-based systems.
->Better Stock Management: Identifying low stock levels to reorder.

Scalability Potential: While this PoC focuses on books, the system could easily be extended in a full implementation to include:
Cafe inventory and sales.
Customer loyalty programs.
Staff management.
Online ordering.
